                <h1>Personal Summary</h1>
                <p>My name is Theodore and I am currently studying Computer Science at Kent State University.</p>
                <p>I have always loved technology since I was a little kid, and at 15 years old, I built my first computer. 
                    I saved up all of my birthday and Christmas money over the years, and bought computer parts one by one. 
                    Once I had acquired all of the parts necesary to complete my computer, 
                    I figured out how to put them all together like pieces in a complex jigsaw puzzle.</p>
                <p>I struggled to get the computer to turn on for about a week, but with perseverience, one day some lights 
                    on the motherboard began to blink upon hitting the power button. I heard the fans ramping up 
                and listened as they began to spin. My monitor grabbed my attention, it began to flicker and then I saw
            an "MSI" logo pop into existence.</p>
            <p>Finally, I was successful and was able to gain access into the BIOS where I installed Windows 10 through flash media.</p>
            <p>Ever since that day as a 15 year old kid, I have fallen more and more in love with computers on a day to day basis.
                I have special drive towards learning about computers and technology that will launch me into a life full of amazing experiences.
